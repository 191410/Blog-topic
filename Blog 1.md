# Improving the Timber Stand on Your Property This Fall

## By Skyler Partain
Timber stand improvement (TSI) is an important management practice you should utilize this fall. TSI is an important aspect of wildlife management and helps us to increase biodiversity and allow a more abundant supply of food for various wildlife species on our property. I perform TSI practices annually to ensure that my property is providing wildlife with all of the essential nutrients they need to flourish. When implementing TSI practices, it is important to eradicate all invasive species. A list of these invasive species should be available on the website of your state’s forestry department. In general, I usually leave 20-25’ between each mature tree which will allow the understory plants to establish. These understory plants will provide a large source of nutrients for wildlife species, such as whitetail deer and turkey. The desired tree species that I like to leave on my property are, Oaks, Yellow Poplar trees, Ashes, Walnuts, fruit trees as well as several other tree species. These trees provide a nutrition source for wildlife species throughout the year and are desired in the timber markets. Oaks for example, provide deer with a high protein source in the winter. When selecting the desired tree species, I will mark each tree I wish to keep with blue spray paint. This will prevent whoever removes the undesired tree species from killing the highly productive species you wish to keep. After I have marked all of the desired trees, I will either contract out the job to a company to come through and eradicate the unwanted trees or I will perform the task myself depending on how large the timber stand is. When removing unwanted tree species, there are two common ways to eradicate the trees. The first is felling each tree. This method requires a person with a chainsaw or hatchet to manually cut down each tree. While this method is quick and easy, sprouts often shoot out of the stumps and the trees don’t actually die. The second way you can remove the undesired trees is to girdle the tree. For this method, someone needs to cut the bark 360 degrees around the tree about an inch wide which will prevent the tree from transporting essential nutrients and will kill the tree. This is my personal preference because this method is less dangerous and is feasible for every landowner. After I have either removed the unwanted trees from my timber stand, I will wait about a year or until the leaves will easily crumble off of the dead trees, and I will perform a prescribed fire. This will remove the dead brush on the ground and will allow for more understory plants to establish, which will provide and abundant amount of forage for wildlife species and will increase the value of your property. TSI is an important management practice that you can utilize this fall to increase the value of your property as well as create a healthy environment for various wildlife species.  I hope you enjoy your time in the woods this fall and may you have a blessed week.
