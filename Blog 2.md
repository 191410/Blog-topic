# Creating a Buffet for Wildlife on Your Property
A lot of people are always curious as to how they can see more deer on their property. Whether you are trying to increase the amount of deer on your property or any wildlife species for that matter, one of the best wildlife management practices you can implement on your property to increase the population is to increase the amount of available forage. Having a variety of vegetative species allows the wildlife to choose what they want to eat just as humans choose what they want to eat at buffets. By creating more desired plant and tree species on your property this fall, you can significantly increase the number of wildlife species on your property. Wildlife prefer properties that have the most biodiversity because they have more resources at their disposal. Think about this question for a moment. Would you rather live in a corn field your entire life where all you have to eat is corn, or would you rather live in a grocery store where you have access to a variety of resources? Most people would agree that the grocery store would be better because they wouldn’t have to consume the same thing every day.
 Just like humans, wildlife are picky and will find the “grocery store properties”. Once they find properties where there is a diverse set of resources, they will spend most of their time on these properties. This is why a lot of landowners often complain about not seeing certain wildlife species. This can all change by simply adding more forage to your property this fall.
There are several ways that you can add more forage to your property. One of the best ways is to develop food plots near wooded timber areas. There are several types of plant species that you can put in your food plots. Depending on the target wild game species you are trying to develop effects what plants you should use for your food plots. If you are trying to increase the amount of deer, I recommend planting either soybeans, corn, or clover. These are highly desired species by deer. There are many food plot blends that are on the market that are also good to use in your food plots. The best way to figure out what to grow on your property is to take soil samples and find out what plants will do the best.
The size of your food plots can vary depending on how much land you own and how much money you are willing to put into your property. However, any size plot will be beneficial and will attract more wildlife species. 
Another management practice that you can implement this fall is planting fruit trees on your property. Fruit trees provide a high energy source for wildlife in the late fall early winter months. Having fruit trees distributed throughout your property will provide wildlife with a good food source at a time when there is not as much forage available due to the cooler weather. Other trees such as white oaks and red oaks also provide wildlife with a high protein source at a time when they need to produce more energy to survive through the winter.
A third option which is usually more cost effective in the short term is putting out automatic feeders and mineral sites to feed wildlife. It is important however to note that every state has different regulations pertaining to the feeding of wildlife. Some states may only allow you to feed wildlife at certain times of the year. It is important to always research your conservation department in your state to find out what regulations are in place. With that being said, this is an easy wildlife management practice that all landowners can implement.
Adding more desired forage species to your property this fall is an important strategy that you should consider. The next time you tour your property look around to determine if you are providing your wildlife with a gourmet buffet. Adding more available forage is a strategy that all professionals utilize throughout the year. I hope you consider increasing the amount of nutrition on your property this fall.
