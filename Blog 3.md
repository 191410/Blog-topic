# Maintaining Healthy Wildlife Herds This Fall
 An important wildlife management practice that many landowners don’t always focus on is maintaining healthy populations of wild game species. Many people focus on steadily increasing the population but often times they end up with over-populated properties and don’t even realize. I often find myself making the same mistake because as landowners, we want to have high numbers of wild game species to hunt and to increase the value of our property. The problem with this philosophy is that often times it actually deteriorates the health of our animals and land. 
High numbers of wildlife species can lead to the spread of disease, which, if not taken care of, can wipe out the entire population. It also affects the health of the animal itself because they are constantly competing with each other for food and can become malnourished.  Parasites and other organisms can spread quicker have a negative effect on the amount of animals present on your property.
Now that I have shed light on a dreary subject, I am glad to inform you that all of these issues can be solved by simply maintaining healthy populations through hunting and trapping. These are easy methods that all landowners can implement on their property this fall. Before you begin to trap or hunt wild game species on your property, it is crucial to know what the current population number is for various species on your property. One way you can figure this out is by performing a trail camera survey of your property. This will allow you to figure out what species need to be thinned out. Contact your conservation department in your state to find out what the population should be for each species in your geographical region.  They can also provide you with information on how to perform a trail camera survey effectively. A lot of this will depend on the amount of forage that is available to wildlife on your property.
After you have figured out the current populations on your property, you can begin thinning out certain over-populated species. I always like to set goals and then use hunting methods to reach the desired population. Each state has different hunting regulations that you have to follow when culling out different wild game species. For some animals, such as small game animals, you can also use traps to reduce the unhealthy populations, which is an easy method to reduce overpopulated species.
Maintaining healthy herds with the use of hunting methods and trapping is an important over-looked task that you can perform this fall. It can also be quite enjoyable if you take your family out hunting with you to help meet your management goals. Many landowners find it very rewarding to take their kids or other family members out hunting and to develop a special bond with them. I hope you are enjoying God’s creation and having fun this fall.
